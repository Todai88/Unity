This will serve as a repository for me to track my progress throughout my Unity development.
I'm also hoping to add some nice resources later on.

1.) Number Wizard (console) -> 

	A simple console program that lets the user think of a number between 1-1000 that the 
	program attempts to guess by using button clicks (up, down and return). 
	It also keeps count of the number of guesses as well as allows the user to reset the 
	game loop.
