<h1><b>Unity</b></h1> 
Welcome to my Unity repository.

Here I'll add some repositories I've worked on together with some problems for you to solve as well as some good resources for you!

<ul>
	<h3><li>Assignments:</li></h3>
	Here you will find assignments that I've finished. If you want to cheat or if you get stuck you can check my Solutions folder!
	<h3><li>Solutions:</li></h3>
	Here you will find my solutions to the assignments.
	Before you cheat, if that's what you want to do, have a look at the solution-logic as that might give you an idea of 
	how to solve your problem before you check the actual source code! :)
	<h3><li>Resources: (TBA)</li></h3>
	Here you will find good resources on subjects that might be covered in the assignments.

</ul>
