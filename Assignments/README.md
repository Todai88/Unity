<h1><b>Unity</b></h1>

Here I'll add some assignments for you to finish.

<ol>

<h2><li><b>Number Wizard (console game):</b></li></h2>

<ul>

<h3><li> Problem-case: </li></h3>
	Deliver a simple number guessing game by using Unity's console
	where the user thinks of a number and the 
	computer attemps to find the number by asking the user if the number is higher
	or lower than a guess.
	<br/><br/>
	The user's primary input should be up/down-arrows and return (enter):
	<ul><br/>
	<li>If up is pressed it means that the computer's guess was too low.</li>
	<li>If down is pressed it means that the computer's guess was too high.</li>
	<li>If enter is pressed it means that the computer guessed the right number.</li>
	</ul><br/>

	When the computer eventually guesses the right number you should
	prompt the user if she wished to play again. <br/>
	If return is pressed again you should restart the game!

</ul>

</ol>
